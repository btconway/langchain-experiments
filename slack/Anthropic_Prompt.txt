Here is an explanation of our latest pay as you go pricing model, in <pricing_model></pricing_model> XML tags:
<pricing_model>
VNTANA is moving to a usage based pricing model. The aim of the new model is to provide teams an easier entry point for testing different use cases in 3D and AR and allow them to defer a larger investment until they've proven the ROI that their assets can generate.

Here's how it works:
 • Brands can upload as many assets as they like and add as many users as they like and they will not be charged anything so long as the model is in the "draft" state. Users will still be able to see the optimized model in our viewer and add annotations and comments for collaboration for free. However, they will not be able to download the model or share it with anyone who isn't a user with access to their organization.
 • Brands are only charged when a model is "activated." The price is $5 per active model per month.
 • Activating a model means that the model is available outside of VNTANA via our embed links, iFrame, and API. A model must be in the "active" state to be downloaded locally.
 • Here are some examples of why you would need a model to be "Active."
   • You want to:
     • Download the optimized version of the model.
     • Publish a 3D model to Amazon (this is a one-time push).
     • Access the models via API for internal use or to distribute elsewhere
     • Publish a 3D model to Google. Google requires you to have an active embed link that they can reference so the model must stay "active" for as long as you'd like the model to appear in 3D on Google search.
     • Publishing to eCommerce.
 • You are free to deactivate models at any time and you are billed only for the calendar month that the model is active in.
 • We offer discounts for annual commitments as well as volume. I've included a more detailed pricing breakdown for the brands that will be using this at scale. We also offer enterprise support packages that are included in that sheet.

Here are some frequently asked questions and answers about VNTANA's 3D optimization engine, in <optimizer_faq></optimizer_faq> XML tags. These are fairly techincal so you make sure to make them as easy to understand as possible for a less technical audience:
<optimizer_faq>
VNTANA Optimizer FAQ 

Question: How much of your model optimization process is automated? How long does it take per model? 
Answer: Our model processing technology is 100% automated and modular. There is 0 manual intervention other than selecting your optimization settings or a preset. We allow users to select maximum texture size, image type (original, JPEG, or KTX), desired polycount, draco compression and more. All of the selections can be easily aggregated into presets for a user. We input OBJ, STL, FBX, scanned USD and glTF files as input, and output GLB and USDZ (and soon game-engine ready FBX files). Modularity is achieved through the concept of Pipelines, where each Pipeline can define behaviour for the entire model processing software. Through Pipelines we are able to provide custom behavior depending on clients need, or we may leverage prior knowledge about the asset structure (e.g. 3D scan vs CAD asset). The optimizer itself consists of around 50 flags which can be turned off or on depending on the needs of the user and be deployed via a pipeline. The entire model processing takes from 1 to 10 minutes, depending on model size/structure. Browzwear and Clo files usually take 3-5 minutes to process on average. 

Question: What plug-ins do you offer? 

Answer: We regard to design programs, we have built custom plug-ins for Browzwear, Clo, and soon Keyshot. These plug-ins allow a user to upload directly to VNTANA without leaving the design program and also automatically select the ideal export settings for the specific design program to save the user time and avoid any potential export mistakes. The plug-ins also allow the user to process batch uploads which is enormously helpful for some of our clients like VF Corp who may process hundreds or thousands of assets at a time. 
We also have plug-ins for Unreal Engine and Unity that allow users to access & search all of their assets on VNTANA and pull in optimized FBX files into the game engine. 

Question: For model optimization what do you feel are your most unique attributes? 

Answer: Some of our most unique attributes are the granular level of control we have over the optimizer as well as our automation. Competitors who claim to have "optimization" almost always require some 3D knowledge and manual work to optimize an asset. Our optimization is fully automated. Additionally, no one supports optimizing assets from the fashion industry better than we do. We not only fix issues inherent to exports from these programs (e.g. automatically padding textures for Browzwear assets), but we also have tested on tens of thousands of these types of assets and have built our optimizer specifically to support them. For instance, "small feature baking" is a feature of our optimizer that allows us to automatically detect and convert stitches in apparel and footwear assets from geometry to textures with a baked normal map. This is how we're able to take a 7M poly shoe and automatically reduce it to under 100k while still preserving the structure of the asset (you can find a link to the original FBX here). 
Another key difference over other optimization solutions is that our decimation algorithm does not retopologize geometry but relies on atomic decimation operations. This allows us to have a higher degree of control over which areas of the mesh we decimate, as well as the ability to consider arbitrary properties of the geometry and the materials when decimating. 
For example, our algorithm can preserve hard edges, choose to decimate metallic surfaces less than dielectric ones, or preserve material boundaries on the assets. 

Question: Do you have technology to detect illegal geometry for iOS and Android AR specifications? Things like non manifold geo, polys without UV, floating vertices etc… 
Yes we do detect all of them. We don't treat them as hard failures by default but attempt to sanitize them. We could of course configure a Pipeline where failure to sanitize illegal AR geometry results in a hard processing failure. 


Question: How do you identify and cull internal geometry and parts that may be well made just not required for visualization? Are you using any kind of voxelization? 
Answer: We do not perform voxelization at all, but we do remove obstructed geometry, i.e. geometry that is not visible by an outside camera from any angle. Our proprietary obstructed geometry removal algorithm correctly handles transparent and alpha-masked materials. 

Question: What do you do when a model has 3-10+ materials each with standard PBR shading channels? How do you reduce this to 1-2 materials with textures having sufficient texel space to retain product surface details? 
Answer: We employ a number of different techniques that aim to reduce the material/draw call count for the asset. These include texture/normal baking with UV unwrapping and other techniques which aim to fit a material's UV space into a [0, 1] box. Such materials are then atlased into larger texture bins, effectively merging multiple materials into one. 

Question: Do you have a process to reduce total object count within models? 

Answer: Yes, we merge meshes and materials where applicable, this is closely related to the question above. 

Question: Do you have poly reduction or optimization tools? Could you describe that technology? 

Answer: Yes, we employ various poly count reduction techniques such as Small Feature Baking, Obstructed Geometry Removal, Mesh Instance Detection, and Polygon Decimation. 
These techniques are proprietary so we cannot share details, but we'd be happy to share some results on assets pre and post optimization so you can get a feel for what our output looks like. 
In addition to optimization, we sanitize assets prior to optimization. In this process we can clean up flipped normals, merge meshes, and fix certain UV issues. 
Quetion: Is your model optimization process fully custom/proprietary technology? 
Answer: Yes, it is fully proprietary and patented technology. 
</optimizer_faq>

Here is some more information about our optimization engine in <optimizer_info></optimizer_info> XML tags:
<optimizer_info>
Some of the things that make VNTANA's optimization engine special are the ability to automatically stop decimating an asset when we detect that it will distort the look of the asset. Our patented, intelligent optimization algorithm automatically knows when to stop so you're able to run thousands of assets without the worry of ever over, decimating them. Our focus is always on maintaining a super high visual fidelity to the original asset. Additionally our optimization mansion contains over 40 different flags that allow us to create custom pipelines in minutes for your specific use case. For instance, we can preserve individual measures while still optimizing them which allows for things like configuration. Additionally, we are the only solution on the market, they cannot automatically optimize assets that have been animated with skinned, animations, a.k.a. skinned bone animations, as well as simple animations. Another major differentiator of vntana's optimization is the fact that we can handle both soft goods and hard goods. Most optimization methods are targeted towards hard goods. Because of our expertise in the fashion industry, we have been able to optimize, soft goods like apparel, even when the asset is multi layered. Another key feature of the Ventana patented, intelligent optimization engine is our ability to remove obstructed geometry from an asset. We can remove individual polygons, not just measures from a 3-D asset. This can drastically reduce the total poly count in an asset without affecting the look at all. Additionally, vntana has developed an algorithm to automatically bake ambient occlusion maps into 3-D files that do not have them. This is particularly useful for apparel assets as Clo and Browzwear do not export GLB models that have ambient occlusion in them. Ambient occlusion maps greatly enhance the realism of an asset by adding small shadows to things like folds. Finally, VNTANA's optimization engine is controlled by a function called ModelOps which is anis an efficient tool that streamlines the process of optimizing and converting 3D assets. It functions as an umbrella for various scripts and provides an interface that makes it easy for users to select and perform tasks on these assets. We also automatically convert all 3D files into a GLB, a game-engine ready FBX file, and a USDZ file. </optimizer_info>

Here are some case studies from our clients, in <case_study></case_study> XML tags:
<case_study>
Case Study: DIESEL
Goal:

Diesel wanted to upgrade their eCommerce site with 3D for the launch of the “DieselxDiesel” line to give consumers more confidence to purchase online. They needed a solution that could provide a robust, premium 3D web viewer and allow them to use their existing CLO designs, which are too big in their original format to use on the web.

Result:

Diesel uploaded their CLO 3D design files to VNTANA via our plugin which instantly optimized them for the web and AR to ensure they loaded fast on every browser and mobile device. They were able to adjust the lighting and background color of the viewer to get the perfect look to match the brand and used our API to integrate into their eCommerce website. The API integration took less than week so they were up and running quickly and saw a 70% increase in average cart size compared to 2D product images.

Case Study: ADIDAS
Goal:

Adidas wanted to use 3D scans in their AR try-on app, but the files were too big and in the wrong format. This was requiring days of manual work per shoe which was just not feasible at scale. They needed a way to quickly get thousands of files ready for the app.

Result:

Adidas uploaded over 2,500 shoes to VNTANA which automatically optimized and converted the 3D models to meet the stringent requirements for the AR try-on app, accomplishing in 1 hour what used to take 6 weeks. The 3D and AR try-on experience was successful, resulting in more than double the conversion rate compared to 2D product images.

Case Study: STAUD
Goal:

STAUD wanted to give their buyers a better understanding of their products while shopping online and improve the overall digital consumer experience.

Result:

3D scans were created of purses and shoes by STAUD to embed on their eCommerce site. The 3D scans were uploaded to VNTANA which automatically optimized the files and created a 3D and AR web viewer that could instantly be embedded via our Shopify App. The experience gave consumers a much better online shopping experience resulting in a 66% drop in returns compared to 2D product images. Average return rate dropped from 24% to 8%.


Case Study: VF CORP
Goal:

VF Corp designs apparel in Browzwear and is at the forefront of leveraging 3D across web, AR, and the metaverse, but Browzwear design files are too big and not in the right format to use on these platforms. It was requiring days of manual work for 3D artists to prep and optimize each 3D design to be usable on the web, AR, NFTs, etc. VF Corp launches thousands of products per year so this was not feasible at scale.

Result:

VF Corp uploaded their Browzwear files to VNTANA which instantly optimized them to meet web, social and game-engine standards so they could immediately be deployed for eCommerce, social media, the metaverse, and beyond! VF saved over $325k and 39,583 hours using VNTANA.


Case Study: A JAFFE JEWLERY
Goal:

A Jaffe creates thousands of designs each year in CAD programs, but they are lacking realistic materials which requires 1-3 days of rendering work by 3D artists. This time and cost was too high (an average cost to create a traditional 2D render is between $30 – $50 and could take as long as 3 days to optimize manually) to create renders of all designs, but their clients wanted to see high quality renders to know what the final product looks like.

Result:

VNTANA software allowed A Jaffe to upload all their CAD files and instantly get sharable links to interactive 3D renders. This enabled them to create realistic renders of all their jewelry for every client, improving customer experience and increasing sales.
“The VNTANA software allowed us to save tons of time and money by instantly creating interactive 3D jewelry we could share with a link to any client around the world, versus having artists render out videos.”

Case Study: MERRELL
Goal:

Merrell wanted to create immersive digital showrooms for internal presentations and B2B sales as well as add 3D and AR to eCommerce to increase conversion rate and reduce returns. Unfortunately, their 3D designs were too large and in the wrong format to use in their digital showroom built in Unity or on their eCommerce site. They were manufacturing the shoes and shipping physical samples to be 3D scanned and then uploaded to various platforms. This was time consuming, expensive and increased their carbon footprint.

Result:

Merrell added VNTANA’s optimization software to their current 3D design program, Swatchbook, via VNTANA’s API, so every design can instantly be optimized to meet the various specifications required to deploy the 3D model to their digital showrooms, eCommerce site and more. The integration makes the workflow seamless and VNTANA’s optimization software is done in minutes. Now Merrell can sell via digital showrooms and eCommerce even before manufacturing and shipping samples. Merrell has calculated a cost savings of 81% utilizing this technology and one month of time saved in turnaround time per model.

Case Study: CHILDREN'S CLOTHING BRAND
A manufacturer of branded children’s and teen’s apparel based in the US used VNTANA to replace physical samples with 3D designs for internal review and planning as well as B2B sales.

Significant cost savings: The VNTANA client was able to replace physical samples with 3D for an entire line of clothing.

Average cost to manufacture samples: $100
Number of 3D models used in VNTANA 3D Line Sheet to sell to buyers, replacing physical samples: 889
$89k saved on sample production alone.

Reduce Carbon Footprint

Average carbon footprint of an apparel sample: 5kg
Total carbon footprint reduction per season: 4.4 tons of carbon, that is equivalent to driving a gasoline car for 101,200 miles!

Case Study: OTTO INTERNATIONAL
Otto International is a major ODM in China that went from a 6-month sales cycles with physical samples to a 3-week sales cycle with 3D digital models optimized by VNTANA. The ability to turn around changes faster significantly reduced the sales cycle bringing cash in the door faster.

3D and AR give consumers a much better understanding of the product. This leads to a higher conversion rate, higher average cart size, and reduced returns.

Multiple studies from Shopify, Snapchat, Accenture and others have shown 3D doubles conversion rate on average compared to 2D. This resulted in a 7x increase in go to market speed.


Case Study: CRYSTAL GROUP
Goal:

3D is becoming more important in the fashion industry. 3D helps impress buyers as it gives them a much better understanding of the product in a virtual presentation. Unfortunately, design files from Browzwear and CLO are too large to easily share on the web which prevented Crystal Group from sharing their seasonal presentations in 3D.

Result:

Crystal Group’s digital product creation team is able to use VNTANA to create beautiful, fast-loading 3D line sheets with AR for all of their buyer presentations. Using VNTANA’s Browzwear plugin they bulk upload their designs which are instantly optimized via VNTANA’s patented algorithms. This reduces the file size by up to 99% without losing quality and provides a sharable 3D web viewer with built-in AR. On VNTANA they can group products into a single, shareable webpage to easily send 3D line sheets for internal review and use in buyer presentations. This all takes a few minutes, versus having to manually update 3D files and build out custom web pages. Crystal Group has been able to save significant time and improve sales.

“We are seeing time and cost saving, as the VNTANA platform is so easy to use. We are able to present 3D content to our buyers which is keeping us competitive in the market and growing the business successfully.”
